 Java Student Grade Marking System – Project Overview
Project Title:
Student Grade Marking System using Java
 Description:
The Student Grade Marking System is a simple Java program designed to input a student's marks, calculate the total and average, and then determine the corresponding grade based on predefined criteria. This program helps automate basic grading tasks and improves accuracy in evaluating student performance.

 Key Features:
User Input: Accepts marks for subjects using the Scanner class.

Validation: Ensures marks are within a valid range (e.g., 0 to 100).

Total and Average Calculation: Automatically computes the total score and average.

Grade Assignment: Assigns grades based on average marks using grading logic (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).

Result Display: Outputs the total, average, and final grade to the console.

How It Works:
The program prompts the user to enter marks for a fixed or dynamic number of subjects.

It sums the marks and calculates the average.

Based on the average, it assigns a grade using conditions like:

90–100 → A

80–89 → B

70–79 → C

60–69 → D
 Benefits and Learning Outcomes:
Strengthens understanding of conditional statements (if-else).

Reinforces use of arrays or variables to store multiple values.

Practices working with user input and simple data validation.

Encourages modular code design through methods (e.g., calculateGrade()).

Possible Enhancements:
Accept multiple students and store data in arrays or lists.

Add file I/O to save and load student records.

Use classes and objects to represent student data (OOP approach).

Implement a graphical interface using Java Swing or JavaFX.
